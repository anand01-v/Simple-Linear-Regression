# Simple-Linear-Regression

- Simple linear regression is a technique that can be used to understand the relationship between a single explanatory variable and a single response variable.
- It finds a line that best fits the data to implement simple linear regression in Python, we can use packages such as scikit-learn, which provides a class called     Linear Regression that can fit a linear model to the data and calculate the coefficients and the intercept. 
- We can also use other packages such as statsmodels or numpy to perform simple linear regression in Python.

## Implementation 
- Importing the required libraries.
- Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the data.
- Checking the correlation between the dependent and the independent variables.
- Fitting the model using Ordinary Least Squares Method.
- Applying Transformations like:
- Log Transformation,Square-Root Transformation,Cube-root Transformatin,Exponential Transformation,Quadratic Transformation.
- Finding the best fit model by R-Square.
- Predicting the dependent variable by using Independent variable.
